p(meta). 2009 Sept 1 - Labadee, Haiti

p. This is a brief post, primarily, to post my slides from this past weekends Jacksonville CodeCamp 2009. Hats off to the organizers, everything went smoothly and UNF is a great venue for this type of event. I'll try to detail all my thoughts in a future post. I met great people like Ryan Parsley and Gabor Liptak (sp?), and had an enjoyable time.

p. I simply ran out of time getting this out the door before my trip, but, better late than never.

p. Big thanks to Desi for her input on this presentation.
