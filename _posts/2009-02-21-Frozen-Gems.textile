We came, we saw, we borrowed footwear, and we plunged!

Desi, Lark, and myself all dove into a frozen-over lake in Wisconsin, in February.

Lark and I had two motives for participating in the "2009 Polar Plunge for Special Olympics":http://www.specialolympicswisconsin.org/polar_plunge.asp. One reason for plunging was to raise money for charity and we succeeded in raising over $1500 for nearly 10,000 athletes with cognitive disabilities. The secondary motivation was to share our hometown of Madison, WI with our friends and co-workers.
