Mark your calendars, the March edition of RefreshJax is scheduled and we want you to answer this question: What are you doing?

No, we're not presenting "Twitter":http://twitter.com. We want to know what you're working on! We'll give you five minutes, you give us a demo of what you're working on recently. No slides? No problem! Bring up you application, artwork, photos or music.

Have you created an awesome new product feature? Designed a kick-ass logo? Or created an earth-shattering remix? Share it with us! we're looking for variety too. Audio, Video, Photos, Web, Textile, or Print all are welcome. 

h3. Rules:

* You should have participated in creating what you demo.
* We'll give you five minutes.
* You give us a look at your creations, your passion.

We would love to see some new faces up in front of the group but, everyone is welcome to speak. 

If you have special needs, outside of a projector and/or a laptop, let us know and we will be as accommodating as possible.

P.S. Remember refresh is always BYOB.
